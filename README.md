# Car-buy-Sell
Overview
This project is a web application for buying and selling cars. It leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and incorporates a machine learning model using linear regression for price prediction.

Features
User Interface: A responsive and user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.
Car Listings: Users can list cars for sale with detailed information such as make, model, year, mileage, and price.
Search and Filter: Search functionality with filtering options to help users find cars that meet their criteria.
Price Prediction: A machine learning model implemented with JavaScript, using linear regression to predict the price of a car based on its features.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Machine Learning: JavaScript (with a linear regression model)
Getting Started

How It Works
Listing Cars: Users can fill out a form to list their cars for sale, providing necessary details such as make, model, year, mileage, and asking price.
Viewing Listings: All listed cars are displayed in a grid, with search and filter options to help users find specific cars.
Price Prediction: The price prediction feature uses a linear regression model to estimate the selling price of a car based on its features. The model is trained on historical car sales data and provides real-time predictions as users input car details.
Machine Learning Model
Linear Regression: The linear regression model predicts the price of a car based on its features. The model is trained using a dataset of historical car sales, with features such as year, mileage, and make/model. The model is implemented in JavaScript, enabling real-time predictions on the client side.
Future Enhancements
User Authentication: Implement user login and registration to manage listings and save favorite cars.
Enhanced Predictions: Improve the machine learning model with more advanced algorithms and additional features.
Backend Integration: Integrate a backend server for persistent data storage and advanced functionalities.
